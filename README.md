## Development

To build for development:

1. Run `bower install` in the root directory. This will install dependencies to www/lib/.
2. Run `gulp sass`. This will compile the Sass in scss/ to CSS in www/css/
3. Now you can run standard Ionic commands. `ionic serve` and `ionic emulate` work well. See the Ionic docs.
